# Tools & Snippets

This repo is just a dumping ground for bits of code as I need them. Not much to see here yet, other than...

[MongoTimeStampConvertor.js](https://github.com/snowmeister/tools-and-snippets/blob/master/MongoTimeStampConvertor.js) - Does what it says on the tin, give it a MongoId and it will give you the date and time it was created.
